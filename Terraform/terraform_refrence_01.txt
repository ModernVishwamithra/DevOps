terraform validate - checks the configuration and syntax - but it doen't mean that always logic is correct
terraform plan - its dry run, when we want to know about infrastructure created or destroyed or modified
terraform apply -apply the IaaS and deploy infrastructure but you have to give apporve by providing consent 'yes'
terraform apply --auto-approve : apply with auto-approve, it won't ask you consent
terraform state - it shows the list of options 
terraform state list - it shows the list of resources that was modified 
terraform state mv <resource-name-old> <resource-name-new>  : it renames the <resource-name> with new one
terraform state rm <resource-name> : when you dont want the resource in terrform control, you can remove that resource from only terrform state but not delete from cloud
terraform state show <resource-name> - shows entire details of the resources that have aassociated with terraform
terraform destroy - destroys all the resources created by terraform as per the statelist
    - there are few ways to detroy resource(s)
    * One way is delete the particular resource code or comment it , run 'terraform apply', it will checks with state file and destroys the resource as it is not present in the code
    ** Other way is using 'terraform destroy -target <resource-name>' and delete the code 
 
# ${var.cidr_block} 
# var.env 
# this will check for variable declaration, these are present in variables.tf file
# if we have not declared, when we run terraform validate/plan/apply.. it will throw error that variable not declared
# even after declaration we can change any variable value by simply giving the value in CLI 
# example - suupose we want to change "var.cidr_block" , we can give **terraform plan -var="cidr_block=10.75.1.0/16"**
# we can give multiple var in the CLI - terraform plan -var="**var-name & value" -var="**var-name & value"

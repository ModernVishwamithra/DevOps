thereare many ways to use a variables in terraform

variable "image_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "availability_zone_names" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["us-west-1a"]
}

variable "docker_ports" {
  type = list(object({
    internal = number
    external = number
    protocol = string
  }))
  default = [
    {
      internal = 8300
      external = 8300
      protocol = "tcp"
    }
  ]
}

"Arguments"
Terraform CLI defines the following optional arguments for variable declarations:

default - A default value which then makes the variable optional.
type - This argument specifies what value types are accepted for the variable.
description - This specifies the input variable's documentation.
validation - A block to define validation rules, usually in addition to type constraints.
sensitive - Limits Terraform UI output when the variable is used in configuration.
nullable - Specify if the variable can be null within the module.

Variable Definition Precedence
The above mechanisms for setting variables can be used together in any combination. If the same variable is assigned multiple values, Terraform uses the last value it finds, overriding any previous values. Note that the same variable cannot be assigned multiple values within a single source.

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

1.Environment variables
2.The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
3.The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
4.Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames. 
5.Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)


# ${var.cidr_block} 
# var.env 
# this will check for variable declaration, these are present in variables.tf file
# if we have not declared, when we run terraform validate/plan/apply.. it will throw error that variable not declared
# even after declaration we can change any variable value by simply giving the value in CLI 
# example - suppose we want to change "var.cidr_block" , we can give **terraform plan -var="cidr_block=10.75.1.0/16"**
# we can give multiple var in the CLI - terraform plan -var="**var-name & value" -var="**var-name & value"
